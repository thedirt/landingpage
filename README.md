About
-----------------------------------
This directory has the new landing page for The Dirt, distributed by The
Duke Chronicle. The new landing page has several objectives:

1. Serve as a location to sign up for The Dirt, relatively free of association with The Chronicle.
2. Provide an aesthetically attractive website to show to potential advertisers in the future.


Structure
-----------------------------------
As of the first version (1.0), The Dirt's landing page consists of a static HTML file, accompanied by js, css, and media folders.

The form itself links directly to a MailChimp sign up list - this was done with the following documentation:

http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website
